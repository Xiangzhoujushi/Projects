            <h1 style="color:orange">Welcome to Pei-yuan's blog</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Apart from studying for my curriculum coursework, I also spend time reading literatures and histories in my spare time. I play many sports as well, basketball, badminton, and table tennis. Especially, I had the experience of playing for high school flag-football team; I was also a part of the running team for junior and senior high schools. 

            Moreover, I love travelling and have already visited a lot of places. I have been to 20 provinces in China, 15 states in United state, and 3 countries of the world.  

            I like to learn about the culture and history of cities that I visit. I normally would walk along the main stree of the downtown to feel and enjoy the cultural ambience, taste delicious and special food, visit all famous and worthgoing places.

	    	<h3>Xiangyang - My First Home</h3>
	    	<br>
	    		<p>I was born in Xiangyang (/Hs'iang yang/) (襄阳), used to be called Xiang Fan，in Hubei province. I lived in Xiangyang for about 9 years. It holds my whole precious childhood memories. I really crave to live for some years in Xiangyang in future after completing my study.
	    		 </p> 
	    		 <p>XiangFan is an integration of two ancient cities: Xiangyang （襄阳） and Fancheng(樊城). The name was changed to Xiangyang, probably for attracting tourists.
	    		  Xiangyang is a famous townthroughout the history because it is right on the "border line"
	    		   that divides not only south and north, but also east and west. This "border line" is meaningful, because it partitions climates, landscapes, and even cultures. Moreover, its specific features also contribute to its importance in the war. It is the inevitable city to be conquered in all civil wars of through Chinese history. 
	    		</p>
	    		 <p>It is also known among people because of Luo Guanzhong (罗贯中)'s novel, <i>Romance of Three Kingdoms</i> and Zhuge Kongming. (诸葛亮/诸葛孔明）The place, where Zhuge kongming lives when he farms, Crouching Dragon (卧龙岗), is located in Xiangyang. Now, it is famous because it is a main city in Louis Cha(金庸) ‘s novel, <i>The Romance of the Condor Heroes</i> (神雕侠侣). </p>
	    		
	    		 <p>Xiangyang is the "center" of China. From this beautiful section of Google map, every one can feel it<a href= 'https://www.google.com/maps/place/Xiangyang,+Hubei,+China/@48.6714043,78.3649305,3.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3680439de5297b49:0xbf2e8f9bfc4114f4!8m2!3d32.009016!4d112.122426'> (The location of Xiangyang).

	    	<h3>Beijing - My Second Home</h3>
            <br>
	    		<p>
	    		I moved to Beijing when I was 9, with my family.
	    		I loved "Beijing" as well. It is the place for me to 
	    		level up my horizon and knoweldge. The most fascinating thing is that it is also an ancient city, full of histories and cultures. 
            </p><p>
                I had lived in Peiyuan for 9 years as well, before I came to the US for college. I indeed appreciate my parents for the ideal living and studying environment they created. I was accepted in a top middle school in Dongcheng (东城) district and went to High School Attached to Tsinghua University （清华大学附属中学） thereafter. 
            </p><p>
                If you plan to visit Beijing, I would be happy to become your tour guide. I really enjoy travelling, and therefore I know all kinds of fun places here in Beijing, including ancient spots, museums, parks, and even shopping marts.
	    		</p>

                <p>Even picutres of common sites in Beijing are beautiful, Aren't they?</p>
